# Crowdfunding Analyis using Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This document focuses on the use of organization and data analysis to examine the results of a data series throughout the main spreadsheet named "Kickstarter". Filters, pivot tables, formulas, line and bar graphs, analysis of variance, standard deviation, etc. were used to carry out the analysis of the proposed Crowdfunding dataset. See the next heading to visualize the Crowdfunding analyisis on detail.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The outcome of this analysis shows the following:

*Figure 1. Outcomes Based on Launch date*

In figure 1, three lines can be seen along the horizontal and vertical axes. We can observe along the linear graph, the count of outcomes as a function of time *f(t)*(which in this case are the twelve months of the year). The graph in figure 1 can be interpreted as follows:
- **Successful Outcomes (Blue line)**
  - According to the successful outcomes of the theater subcategory during the months of January to December, the outcomes show that in January began with a count of 56 successful results, from there the graph varied a little in the months of February to April.
The graph reached its peak in the month of May with a count of 111 successful outcomes and from there began to decrease until September with a count of 59 successful results.
In the month of October, the counts slightly increased and then decreased again until December with a final count of 37 successful results.
- **Failed Outcomes (Red line)**
  - For the failed outcomes of the theater subcategory counts, a more stable graph can be observed compared to the successful outcomes.
Starting with 33 failed outcomes in the month of January you can see a small variation in counts through the month of April.
Again in the month of May it reached the highest peak with a count of 52 failed results and from that month the graph stabilizes a bit until the month of August. In the month of September, a decrease in the graph can be observed to reach a count of 34 failed results. Another gently increase is observed in the month of October and the greatest decrease of the entire graph in the month of November, dropping to 31 failed outcomes and for the month of December the count ends with 35 failed results.
- **Canceled Outcomes (Yellow line)**
  - On this outcomes we can se the lowest counts of the three results. We start with the peak of cancelations in the month of January with a count of 7, from then through the month of september we can barely see a variation of counts. On the month of october we can see that the graph decreased to the lowest point with 0 counts and slightly increased in the month of november and december with 3 canceled outcomes.
